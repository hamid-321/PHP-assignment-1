Individual php assignment to represent a delivery system for admins and delivery users, providing CRUD permissions to admins.

First attempt at using php

To run the project, download all flies and set up a php webserver in php storm.

Once again the project has been hosted on a live server to allow easy access for viewing: 

http://sgc488.poseidon.salford.ac.uk/clientserver/

sidenote: there are 2 accessible accounts in the delivery system currently - 
1- Username: admin Password: 123456
2- Username: lee   Password: 123456

These are not the most secure passwords but it was what the assignment required.
